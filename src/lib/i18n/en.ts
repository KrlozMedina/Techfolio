    aboutMe: "I am Carlos Alidio Medina López, a technology enthusiast and software developer. Currently, I hold the position of technical leader in an electronics laboratory for a multinational company. During my free time, I dedicate myself to studying software development and creating applications to apply my knowledge. I love exploring the world and staying up-to-date with the latest technology trends.",
    educationTitle: "Educational Background",
    education1: "I completed my degree in Electronics Technology at the Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, where I worked on a degree project focused on designing a VRLA battery meter and analyzer. This project involved the development of both hardware and software. On the hardware side, I designed a circuit to capture voltage and perform controlled charging and discharging of the batteries. For the software, I created a program in Matlab that performed the necessary calculations and generated final reports.",
    education2: "I continued my academic journey with a degree in Control and Automation Engineering, also at the Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas. During my degree project in this field, I participated in the digital transformation of a chemical production plant. I collaborated in the development of a web application that displayed plant data, improving efficiency and decision-making in the company. To achieve this, I worked on data capture from a PLC, conversion to HTTP protocol through a local server, sending data to an API implemented in AWS, and finally visualizing the data in the web application.",
    professionalExperienceTitle: "Professional Experience",
    experience1: "I started my professional experience in the field of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) maintenance, where I gained skills in electronic systems and renewable energy. I developed a solid understanding of electronic systems and the connection between different stages of UPS. I also had the opportunity to participate in renewable energy projects and contributed to the implementation of the company's first photovoltaic system.",
    experience2: "Later, I joined a digital payment solutions company, where I quickly progressed and became a technical leader. During my time there, I acquired skills in leadership, production planning, and quality methods. I participated in the implementation of methods to improve the quality of the laboratory, and we obtained ISO9001 certification. One of our greatest achievements was winning the award for the best repair center in Latin America. Additionally, I led a project to automate environmental variable records in the laboratory, which allowed us to have more accurate data and reduce paper usage.",
